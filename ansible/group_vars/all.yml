# We create fixed user accounts to provide an isolated execution environment to run the jupyter notebooks
# They are called studentXXX where XXX is comprised between USERMIN and USERMAX defined below poentially with the addition of an offset (UIDBASE) for their uid/gid
# Their home directory is located under /student and is thus named /student/studentXXX

#
# USERMIN indicates the starting ID of the Linux and Jupyter user account range
#
USERMIN: 1
#
# USERMAX indicates the ending ID of the Linux and Jupyter user account range
